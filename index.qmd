Hello and welcome to my page!

My name is Timbila Nikiema, and I have built a solid educational foundation in finance, complemented by a growing expertise in quantitative analysis. I earned my Bachelor of Business Administration with a major in Finance from Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business, where I developed a strong analytical mindset and a passion for financial modeling.

Currently, I am furthering my education by pursuing a Master of Science in Quantitative Methods and Modeling at Baruch College. This advanced degree is enhancing my ability to apply complex quantitative techniques to real-world financial challenges.

In my professional roles as a Senior Financial Analyst at St. Barnabas Health System and a Senior Corporate Financial Analyst at Northwell Health, I have gained valuable experience in financial analysis, budget management, and strategic planning. These experiences have solidified my commitment to using data-driven insights to support organizational success.
