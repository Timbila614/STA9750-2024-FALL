<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of transit data from 2022, focusing on several key areas including fare revenues, expenses, transit usage, and performance across various agencies and modes of transportation in the United States. The tasks performed in the analysis explore trends in unlinked passenger trips (<code>UPT</code>), vehicle revenue miles (<code>VRM</code>), fare-box recovery ratios, and cost efficiency in terms of expenses per UPT. Data was collected from public sources, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, and processed using R to draw meaningful insights.</p>

<section id="data-overview" class="level1">
<h1>Data Overview</h1>
<p>The data used in this analysis includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fare Revenue Data</strong>: Contains information on fare revenue earned by various transit systems.</li>
<li><strong>Expense Data</strong>: Contains financial information related to transit expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Ridership Data</strong>: Contains monthly figures on unlinked passenger trips (<code>UPT</code>) and vehicle revenue miles (<code>VRM</code>) for different transit agencies and modes.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Loading and Cleaning <code>FARES</code> and <code>EXPENSES</code> Data The first step in the analysis was downloading the fare revenue and expense data-sets from the DOT website and cleaning them to create tables for further analysis.</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This analysis highlights the performance of various transit systems across the U.S., with <strong>New York City’s MTA</strong> consistently leading in both VRM and UPT. The <code>Motorbus</code> mode proves to be the most heavily utilized, while <strong>Anaheim’s Transportation Network</strong> demonstrated an impressive <code>fare-box recovery</code> ratio, suggesting a highly efficient operation. These findings provide valuable insights for transit agencies in terms of resource allocation, planning, and operational efficiency, while also offering a benchmark for future performance assessments.</p>
